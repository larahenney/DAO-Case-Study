# DAO-Case-Study
This was a case study for a class of mine. We were given a buggy application and told to fix it. I have fixed it, refined it, and added features/classes like the Database Manager and validating class as well.

There is a Database Manager class that uses a properties file to store its username/password/url. I did not include the file that contains said document in this repository but if you are running this code you will need a properties file/resource folder. The path to the JDBC driver is also coded into the project itself so there was no need to instantiate it in my code. 

This is my first major java project; I'm very proud of it. That said I know there are areas for improvement that I may get around to if I have time.  

In the future I am planning on (in no particular order): 
  
  Letting the user choose more options before the application closes. 
  Adding options to the main menu like an Insert Customer Option and more varied queries in general.
  Cleaning up Exception Handling. 
  Fixing up result formatting to print out month names/Get dates to read more cleanly.
